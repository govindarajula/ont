2. Predictive ML models for Prototyping (3D Print & Additive Manufacturing)

* Developed a prediction system for prototyping complex geometries and evaluating tool parameters. 
* The engineered model can store experimental knowledge and predictions from CAD model and tested as a guidance system for Julia 3D printer with successful builds of lag, cap screws.
* Developed predictive models with (Decision Tree-based ensemble methods) Random Forest to assess rapid prototyping models, tabulating build quality and tool wear for machine components.
* Cross-validated the prediction results with SVM, and with parameters of synthesized tools, before deployment at the Design lab.
* **Keywords** (Semantics, Rapid Prototyping, CAD, Java/Protégé, Predictive Models)
