Formal knowledge appears naturally in almost every area of endeavor where computers are used intensively, and knowledge management is required. Nowadays we observe the evolution process that brings knowledge from the human-readable form (i.e. archive of documents with searchable information) into the more-and-more computer-readable form that allows for automated deductive reasoning – Ontologies. One can say that Ontologies contain Machine Executable Knowledge - knowledge that can be executed by a machine.

Unfortunately, to understand the ontology one is required to have a background in the ﬁeld of an artiﬁcial intelligence, knowledge representations and knowledge modelling. Moreover, it is also desirable to know supporting tools that intensively use advanced diagramming techniques. While without formal methods it is almost impossible to understand the knowledge immersed in the given ontology, it is still very hard to trace a formal knowledge model for an authority that is not familiar with a particular diagramming language.

 In consequence, even data-driven, strategic decisions made by the executives not familiar with tools might reveal a lack of crucial information.
